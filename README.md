This project aims to classify the price of houses into four classes. I used Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression to do this. I scaled data (Standard Scaler and MinMAx Scaler) to check the effect of scaling data on the result. Also, implement Logistic Regression by doing PCA on data with different POVs to examine the impact of POV's amount on the result.
